Ideas:
|_-> Hex decoder to ASCII (Structure done, just need to add the control character from Hex to String
|_-> Color representation, hex and such

Fixes:
|_-> Add Web Workers to the incremental game to allow continual calculations in the background
|_-> Also perhaps make more generic  functions, such as sell and buy 
|_-> Integrate the constants into the machine classes or create json/xml files
|_-> Show items produced per second
|_-> Add percentage increase via buttons (upgrades)
